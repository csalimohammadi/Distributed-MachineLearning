# Distributed-MachineLearning

In this project, we classified Movielens dataset using machine learning different classifiers. The classical approach and also parallel processing approach have been employed.

In this project, we classified Movielens dataset using machine learning different classifiers. 
To train and test our algorithms the classical approach and also parallel processing approach have been employed.
We used Caret to implement various classical classifiers and employed Apache spark platform and two different packages (H2O and Sparklyr) to implement our distributed machine learning algorithms.  

Programming language:
R and R-Studio

Packages:
1- Caret.
2- Sparlyr
3- H2O
